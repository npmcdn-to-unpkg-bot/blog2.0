# blog2.0
Creating a blog project in Angular 2

Gulp is used to compile all files.

In CMD line run:  
       
            npm run gulp
            
            
To start server:

            npm start
        
        
Project runs on localhost: 3000


Project notes:

    Added new components to free up App Component. These include footer, and content components. 
    
    Routing has not been added....HOME and ABOUT links exist but are not hooked up. Any reloads must be currently done via browser refresh.

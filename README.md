# blog2.0
Creating a blog project in Angular 2

Gulp is used to compile all files.

In CMD line run:  
       
            npm run gulp
            
            
To start server:

            npm start
        
        
Project runs on localhost: 3000


Project notes:

    First commit has all functionality in the appComponent. I plan to modularize this as I go along.
